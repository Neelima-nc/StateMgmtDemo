Android App States and Their Significance for PetWell

 1. Created
   - When it happens: This is the initial state when the app is first launched.
   - Why it’s important: Initial setup, including defining UI components and fetching essential resources.
   - What should happen: The app initializes components and loads any essential settings (e.g., default location or pricing options).

 2. Started
   - When it happens: After creation, the app enters the started state, which prepares it to become visible to the user.
   - Why it’s important: Ensures that UI elements are ready and visible but not necessarily interactive yet.
   - What should happen: Loading screens or a splash screen can be displayed here to prepare the app for full interactivity, giving the user visual feedback that the app is loading.

 3. Resumed (Foreground)
   - When it happens: The app becomes fully visible and interactive, where most user interactions happen.
   - Why it’s important: This is where users search for vets, apply filters, and view details.
   - What should happen: PetWell should show current data (like vet listings, ratings, and details). It should also keep the UI updated with real-time information, so if the app has live data (such as ratings or proximity details), it should refresh here.

 4. Paused
   - When it happens: This state is reached when the app loses focus (e.g., when the user opens another app, but PetWell is still partially visible).
   - Why it’s important: Saves temporary data and maintains the app's current state so users don’t lose their place.
   - What should happen: PetWell should save the user’s current session (e.g., search results or selected filters) and prepare to enter the background. Temporary data can be cached here to avoid data loss when users switch back to the app.

 5. Stopped (Background)
   - When it happens: The app is no longer visible to the user, such as when they press the home button.
   - Why it’s important: Prepares the app for potential closure and saves more critical data.
   - What should happen: PetWell should save session data, such as the current page or selected filters, to ensure the user can return to the same place. The app should also pause any non-essential background tasks (e.g., stopping location updates or data polling).

 6. Destroyed
   - When it happens: The app is closed or terminated.
   - Why it’s important: Ensures all data is saved, and resources are properly released to avoid memory leaks.
   - What should happen: PetWell should save user preferences or ongoing session data (like recent searches or filter settings) to local storage. All ongoing processes or listeners should be closed to prevent the app from consuming unnecessary resources when not in use.

 Additional States to Consider for Android Apps with Real-Time Data

 7. Config Changes (e.g., Device Rotation)
   - When it happens: The user rotates the device or changes the screen size, and the app reconfigures.
   - Why it’s important: Ensures the app layout and data remain intact through visual changes.
   - What should happen: PetWell should save the current view state (like open filters or search results) and reload them after the rotation.

 8. Network Connectivity Changes
   - When it happens: The app detects a change in network connectivity (going online/offline).
   - Why it’s important: For apps that rely on real-time data, like PetWell, network changes can disrupt functionality.
   - What should happen: When offline, PetWell should show an error or cached data, if available, and provide an option to retry. When online, it should automatically refresh any live data.

Managing these states in PetWell will help deliver a consistent, user-friendly experience, where the app’s functions, settings, and data remain accessible and stable, even with device or network changes.
